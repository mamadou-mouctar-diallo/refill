# refill

app refill and manage cellular credit

# How to use this app

clone https://github.com/mamadou-mouctar-diallo/refill.git
cd refill and cd backend
cmd: npm install
cd frontend
cmd: npm install
cd ..
To run the Backend and Frontend both
cmd: npm run dev but be sure to be in backend folder
To run Backend only
cd backend
cmd: npm run server
To run frontend
cd frontend
cmd: npm start but here the frontend app needs the backend to fetch the data so you can choose one of the commands above.

I just start using redux for the data store, i used react-route-dom for the routing but i jugged that is redux more confortable, i implemented some redux actions and reducers for users and operators but i did not finish but i did something.
By thank you, i hope be accepted.
